                                    As an industry developer, I work with various fast-paced startups 
                                    to help build their products. In my most recent project, working with company 
                                    Tickerzone, I developed multiple React pages for a real-time stock market 
                                    investment tracking platform. Also, I integrated PostHog analytics into the

                                    the 6 figures of annual revenue generated by our conferences; I developed and
