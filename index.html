                University of California, Berkeley! When I'm not working on projects, I like to spend my time 
                golfing, reading, and looking at videos of <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RIRNPQG1SI">caracals</a>. 
                Listed here are past and current projects alongside any relevant experience I've had in my software 
                engineering pursuits. You can contact me at <a href = "mailto:nickangelici@berkeley.edu">

                    <p>Utilizing the Twitter API and the BotoMeter API, I automated a twitter account to 
                        randomly sample twitter accounts via a stream of twitter activity (for every hour of 
                        every day for 7 days) as to create a confidence interval regarding the number of bots 
                        amongst current active users. Adding one more line to get to five lines, or so.

                    <h3>Dartboard Investing [Stock Investment]</h3>
                    <p>Using a standard electronic dartboard and a Raspberry Pi 4, I utilized the Alpaca 
                        Stock Trading API to pick my stocks via the throw of a dart and have the selected 
                        portfolio automationally invested. Now I am typing for fun to fill out the page, 
                        and to see how long it will take me to type out until I get to five lines. I am 
                        typing slower than usual lol.

                    <p>Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript the website Angelici.com is a simple means to 
                        highlight my portfolio and practice the aforementioned skills. In addition to the 
                        front page, outlining my personal projects and work / club experience, there exists 
                        the "Games" page which contains recreations of Snake, MineSweeper, and 2048. They 
                        exist as means to practice logic with Javascript, and to add some fun.
