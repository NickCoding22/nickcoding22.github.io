                University of California, Berkeley! When I'm not working on projects, I like to spend my time 
                golfing, reading, and looking at videos of <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RIRNPQG1SI">caracals</a>. 
                Listed here are past and current projects alongside any relevant experience I've had in my software

                    <h3>BotChecker [Twitter Bot]</h3>
                    <p>A Twitter bot developed with Twitter4j / the Twitter API and the Botometer API to 
                        determine a confidence interval surrounding the proportion of active Twitter accounts 
                        that are automated. It was run on a Raspberry Pi 4 for each hour of every day for 
                        seven days to obtain comprehensive data of a full week of activity.

                    <h3>Dartboard Investing [Stock Investment]</h3>
                    <p>An unorthodox stock investment tool: through the Alpaca stock trading API and a 
                        Raspberry Pi 4, an electric dartboard was rigged to automatically invest in the 
                        stocks chosen by a dart landing in a spot corresponding to a given stock. 22 
                        fractional stocks were randomly chosen from the NASDAQ each cycle and assigned 
                        spots on the board with varying investment levels.

                        In addition, I recreated classic games such as Minesweeper, Snake, and 2048 and

                    <p>BMUN is the original Model United Nations organization, and continues its 72 year 
                        history in facilitating meaningful discussion on international topics. In the 
                        organization I hold the role of Deputy to the Treasurer, which entails maintaining 
                        the finances over 1250 delegates, and working with the Treasurer in refactoring the 
                        Quickbooks Online invoice system from Python to Java. In addition I will be a Head 
                        Chair for BMUN’s 72nd session, and I will be leading committee for the International 
                        Labour Organisation. As such, I am the primary organizer and contributor to a 50 page 
                        topic synopsis focused on workers’ rights amidst changing technologies; I am 
                        responsible for preparing my peers for a style of committee unfamiliar to them; 
                        and I am preparing a committee that is to be attended by 70+ students.
