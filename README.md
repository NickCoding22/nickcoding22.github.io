# Personal Website

This is a React-based website that acts as a fully-interactive desktop inspired by early Mac designs. Files (including multiple playable games) and windows can be opened, closed, and moved. In addition, you can access information on my projects and industry experience while also having links to my LinkedIn, Github, and Resume.
